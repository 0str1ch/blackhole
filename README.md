# Blackhole

## Made with react-three-fiber and Next.js

Unreal bloom shader, FXAA, and three.js wrapped in react-three-fiber to create a dynamic and interactive space scene for your viewing pleasure.

### Roadmap

- Add env map to a secondary sphere to refract the light to simulate gravitational lensing
- Add keyboard controls
- Design a new blackhole model in Blender to enable better shaders and reduce shape complexity
- Add other celestial bodies like pulsars, planets, and destructables
- Performance enhancements to keep a buttery 60 FPS
